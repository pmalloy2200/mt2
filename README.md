 The program solves the following system of two 
 first order differential equations, which describe 
 the mass, density and radius of a white dwarf star.
 
 The first program, white-dwarf.c, calculates the density
 gradient of a white dwarf star and prints values of density
 versus mass and radius. Using the makefile and gnuplot, the 
 following graph of density vs. radius is produced:
 ![Rho vs. Radius]

 The second program, white-dwarf-iterate.c, iterates over values of 
 central density from .1 to 1,000,000 and exports mass vs radius as 
 central density increases. Using the makefile and gnuplot, the 
 following graph of total vs. total radius is produced:
